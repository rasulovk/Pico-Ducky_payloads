This repository contains a safe, non-destructive Pico-Ducky / Rubber Ducky payload that simulates:

- a “hacker-style” CMD fullscreen animation
- matrix-style text streaming
- fake IP scanning
- fake password cracking
- fake system breach alert (red flashing)
- a final harmless Rickroll

The script performs zero harmful actions.
It is purely for fun, awareness training, and demonstration.

⚠️ Disclaimer
Use only on systems where you have explicit permission.
This payload is 100% harmless, but still simulates actions that look real.
